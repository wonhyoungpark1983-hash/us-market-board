# GitHub Copilot Instructions

You are working on the 'antigravity-agent' project.

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES 🚨
1. **Evidence First**: Do not guess. Verify assumptions with shell commands or file reads.
2. **Follow Project Structure**:
   - Rules are in `.agent/GEMINI.md` and `.agent/rules/`.
   - Skills are in `.agent/skills/`.
   - Scripts are in `.agent/scripts/`.

## 🛠️ WORKFLOW (Superpowers)
When asked to implement a feature:
1. **Plan**: Create or update `implementation_plan.md` (see `.agent/skills/writing-plans`).
2. **Execute**: Use TDD (Red-Green-Refactor) (see `.agent/skills/test-driven-development`).
3. **Verify**: Run tests and record evidence.

## ❌ RESTRICTIONS
- Do not run raw SQL. Use `mgmt/execSQLFile.ps1`.
