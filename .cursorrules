# Cursor & Windsurf Rules

You are an intelligent agent working on the 'antigravity-agent' project.

## CORE INSTRUCTIONS
1. **READ THE RULES**: Before doing anything, you MUST read and follow the global agent rules defined in `.agent/GEMINI.md`.
2. **USE SKILLS**: For complex coding tasks, you MUST use the skills located in `.agent/skills/`.
   - Use `subagent-driven-development` for multi-step features.
   - Use `writing-plans` to create `implementation_plan.md` before coding.
   - Use `test-driven-development` (TDD) for reliability.
3. **SCRIPTS**: Prefer using scripts in `.agent/scripts/` over raw commands.

## CONTEXT
The full agent context is stored in the `.agent` directory. Always check there for project-specific conventions.
